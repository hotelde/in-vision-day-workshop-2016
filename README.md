# IN Vision Day 2016

## Modern Web Development - Everything You Need to Start

In this intensive workshop we will set up a mobile-first web application with
all the good and state of the art parts. Let's have a look to the latest stable
AngularJS version, HTML5, LESS and Twitter Bootstrap. Everything is built up on
NodeJS with Gulp and Webpack.

At the end of the workshop you have a stable code base to build your own ideas.

Peter is Senior JavaScript Engineer & JavaScript Evangelist at the HOTEL DE GmbH in Nuremberg.
He gives talks at meetups and conferences and organizes the local JavaScript meetup FrankenJS.

## Setup

**If GIT is installed**

Switch to a folder where you want to clone the project into (e. g. `projects`) and run the command below.

```
git clone https://github.com/hotelde/in-vision-day-workshop-2016.git
```

Now switch to the new folder `Ã¬n-vision-day-workshop-2016`.

```
cd in-vision-day-workshop-2016
```

Finally you have to install all dependencies via `NPM`.

```
npm install
```

**Download the zipped project**

TODO: https://some-where.com/foo.zip

This package contains all dependencies. No `npm install` required.

## Start the Development Server

To start coding we have to run our development server. In this technology stack we use webpack to build and serve our project.

```
npm run dev
```

Run the command above to run the webpack development server. After a few seconds it spawns our application at http://localhost:8080.

Open the browser of your choice (but Google Chrome is recommended :)) and navigate to the URL.

If everything went well you should see our shiny new web application.
